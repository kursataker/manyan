## 1 Scope

This Standard defines TLA⁺ Version 2 as a model checker must evaluate it:
the syntax of modules, the meaning of the expressions TLC can evaluate,
the model configuration language, the model-checking procedure, and the
observable results. It follows *Specifying Systems* (Lamport, 2002) and the
TLA⁺ Version 2 language changes. Where those leave a choice open (the order
in which values print, which errors are reported, how many states are
counted), TLC 1.8.0 (tla2tools v1.8.0, built from commit d8fb231) decides.

The proof language (§12) is parsed only as far as needed to skip it.

## 2 Conformance

### 2.1 Oracle

TLC 1.8.0 is the oracle. A test of this Standard is a module, a model
configuration, and the output TLC produces for them. An implementation
conforms when, for every test, it produces the same normalized output (§11.1)
and the same exit status (§11.3).

### 2.2 Requirements

An implementation shall

1. accept every module and configuration this Standard defines;
2. produce, for a correct model, the result TLC produces: the same verdict,
   the same counts of states, and the same error traces;
3. report an error where TLC reports one, with the same first line of the
   message for the errors listed in §11.3, and the same exit status;
4. check models with one worker deterministically: the same inputs give the
   same output.

### 2.3 Normative language

*Shall* states a requirement. *Unspecified* means TLC's choice is not part of
this Standard and tests must not depend on it.

## 3 Lexical structure

### 3.1 Characters

A module is ASCII text. Lines end with LF or CR LF. A tab counts as one
column. Columns and lines are numbered from 1.

### 3.2 Module boundaries

Text before the first line that holds `----` (four or more dashes) followed
by `MODULE` is ignored. A module begins `---- MODULE Name ----` (any run of
four or more dashes on each side) and ends with a line of four or more `=`
characters. Text after the end of the outermost module is ignored. A module
may contain nested modules with the same delimiters.

### 3.3 Comments and white space

`\*` starts a comment running to the end of the line. `(*` starts a
comment that ends at the matching `*)`; such comments nest. A line of four
or more `-` inside a module is a separator and is ignored.

### 3.4 Identifiers and keywords

An identifier is a sequence of letters, digits, and `_` that contains at
least one letter and is not all digits followed by a letter-free tail; for
example `x`, `x1`, `_x`, `1a` are identifiers and `12` is a number. The
following are reserved and are not identifiers:

```
ASSUME ASSUMPTION AXIOM BOOLEAN CASE CHOOSE CONSTANT CONSTANTS ELSE
ENABLED EXCEPT EXTENDS FALSE IF IN INSTANCE LET LOCAL MODULE OTHER
STRING SUBSET THEN THEOREM TRUE UNCHANGED UNION VARIABLE VARIABLES
WITH WF_ SF_ LAMBDA RECURSIVE LEMMA PROPOSITION COROLLARY
```

`WF_` and `SF_` are prefixes: `WF_vars` is `WF_` followed by the
subscript `vars`.

### 3.5 Numbers

A numeral is a sequence of decimal digits. `\b`, `\o`, and `\h` (or `\B`,
`\O`, `\H`) introduce binary, octal, and hexadecimal numerals. A decimal
`d.d` is accepted by the grammar. As TLC cannot compute with either, a
spec with a decimal, or with a numeral above 2^31 - 1, anywhere in a
definition, assumption or theorem is an error before checking (§11.3),
whether it is used or not. The first is reported: the modules in the
order they are finished (dependencies first), and in each its
definitions, its inner modules, its assumptions, then its theorems.

### 3.6 Strings

A string is enclosed in `"`. The escapes are `\"`, `\\`, `\n`, `\t`, `\r`,
and `\f`. A string does not span lines.

### 3.7 Operator symbols

The lexer takes the longest symbol that is a token. The symbols are the
punctuation `( ) [ ] { } << >> , : :: . .. ... ! @ ' == |-> -> <- _`
together with the operators of §6.1. Backslash words (`\in`, `\cup`, ...)
are single tokens; an unknown backslash word is an error.

## 4 Modules

### 4.1 Units

A module is a header, an optional `EXTENDS M1, ..., Mn`, and a sequence of
units: declarations (§5.1), definitions (§5.2), `INSTANCE`s (§4.3),
`ASSUME`s (§4.5), theorems (§12), nested modules, and separators.

### 4.2 EXTENDS

`EXTENDS M` makes every non-`LOCAL` symbol of `M`, and of the modules `M`
extends, a symbol of the extending module. A name defined twice with
different definitions is an error; the same definition reached twice is
one symbol.

### 4.3 INSTANCE

`INSTANCE M WITH p1 <- e1, ..., pn <- en` imports the definitions of `M`
with each constant and variable `pi` of `M` replaced by `ei`. A parameter
not listed is replaced by the symbol of the same name in the instantiating
module, which must exist. `N(x) == INSTANCE M WITH ...` defines a module
instance: `N(a)!Op(b)` is `Op` of the instance with `x` bound to `a`. A
`LOCAL` instance or definition is not exported.

### 4.4 Module resolution

A module named in `EXTENDS` or `INSTANCE` is, in order: a nested module in
scope, a file `Name.tla` in the directory of the root module, or a
standard module (§8).

### 4.5 ASSUME

`ASSUME e` (or `ASSUMPTION`, `AXIOM`, optionally named `ASSUME N == e`)
states that the constant expression `e` is `TRUE`. Each assumption is
evaluated after the constants are bound (§10.1); a false one is an error
(§11.3).

## 5 Declarations and definitions

### 5.1 Declarations

`CONSTANT c1, ..., cn` declares constant parameters, each a name or an
operator shape such as `F(_, _)` or `_ ** _`. `VARIABLE v1, ..., vn`
declares the state variables. The plural spellings are synonyms.

### 5.2 Operator definitions

`Op == e`, `Op(p1, ..., pn) == e`, and the infix, prefix, and postfix forms
`a ++ b == e`, `-. a == e`, `a ^+ == e` define operators. A parameter may
itself be an operator, written `F(_)` or `_ + _`, and an argument for it is
an operator name, an operator parameter, or a `LAMBDA x, y : e`. Arguments are passed by name: the
argument expression is evaluated, in the context of the call, where the
parameter is used.

### 5.3 Function definitions

`f[x \in S] == e` defines `f` as `CHOOSE f : f = [x \in S |-> e]`: `f` may
appear in `e`, so the function is recursive. Several bound variables
`f[x \in S, y \in T]` define a function on `S \X T`.

### 5.4 Recursive operators

`RECURSIVE Op(_, _)` declares an operator that a later definition in the
same unit list defines; the definition may then refer to itself. Evaluation
that does not terminate is an error (§11.3).

### 5.5 LET

`LET d1 ... dn IN e` makes the definitions `di` (operator, function, or
`RECURSIVE` declarations) visible in later `di` and in `e`.

### 5.6 Scoping

A name is visible only after its declaration or definition; a definition
sees itself only when it defines a function or was declared `RECURSIVE`. So
`LET e == CHOOSE e \in S : TRUE IN e` is legal. A bound name may not reuse a
name already visible in its scope, except that names introduced by different
definitions do not conflict. A name refers to the innermost binding.

A nested module sees the names its enclosing modules declare or define
before it, and may not define them again. It may declare again a constant
or variable they declare, with the same arity; SANY warns of it,
`Multiple declarations or definitions for symbol C.` and where the first
is, each location in the module of its file. After processing each
module of a file, dependencies first, SANY prints every warning so far
under `*** Warnings: N`.

When two extended modules define one name differently, the first
definition is the one used, and SANY warns of the other, `Warning: the
definition of 'R' conflicts with` and where the first is; a definition an
instance brings in gives way too, with `Multiple declarations or
definitions for symbol R.`, located at the definition, or at the statement
of a `LOCAL INSTANCE`. A definition's location runs from its name to the
end of its body; one of a standard module's is where it is in TLC's file.

Once every module is processed, SANY warns, module by module, dependencies
first, of each field of a record or set of records (`[f |-> e]`, `[f : S]`)
named as a definition or declaration its module sees: `The field name "f"
in the record constructor is identical to the existing definition or
declaration`, with where each is. It does not when a record or set of
records of the same fields, in the module or one it extends, has a field
whose expression is built, through the definitions it uses, from a
constant, a variable, a parameter, a bound identifier, `BOOLEAN`, `Nat` or
`Int`.

### 5.7 Labels and subexpressions

`lab :: e` or `lab(x, y) :: e`, at the start of an expression, labels `e`
(which extends as far as possible); `x` and `y` are bound identifiers in
scope. A label changes nothing in the value of `e`.

`Op(a)!s1!s2...` names a subexpression of the definition of `Op` (an
operator, a theorem, or an assumption, possibly reached through instances
`I!Op`). Each selector `si` moves from the current expression to a part:

- a name: after `Op`, after a label, or after a LET definition, a label in
  it (not inside another label or LET definition); otherwise a definition
  of the LET the current expression is, after `:` if it would be a label;
- `:` makes the next name a LET definition;
- `n`, `<<`, `>>`: operand `n` of an operator application, the first, or
  the second of two; a LET expression has its body as only operand, a
  label is transparent, `r.f` has operands `r` and `"f"`, a record its
  values, `[f EXCEPT ...]` only `f`, a CASE arm `p -> e` is selected by
  two selectors (`!1!>>` is `e` of the first arm); for a quantifier,
  `CHOOSE`, set constructor or function constructor, operand `n` is the
  set of the `n`-th group of bound identifiers;
- `(e1, ..., en)` or `@`: the body of a quantifier, `CHOOSE`, set or
  function constructor, its bound identifiers (all of them, tuples
  flattened) as parameters.

The result is an operator whose parameters are, in order, those met on the
way: `Op`'s, each label's, each LET definition's, and the bound
identifiers of each `(...)` or `@`. Arguments given to every selector
(`Op(a)!lab(b)!(c)`) apply it; none at all (`Op!lab!@`) make it an
operator argument. The LET definitions around the subexpression are in
scope in it. `COp(1, 2)!(3)!++(4, 5)` is thus `{a, b, q, p, x}` of
`COp(q, p) == CHOOSE x : LET a ++ b == {a, b, q, p, x} IN ...` with
`q, p, x, a, b` = `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.

A theorem `THEOREM N == e` or assumption `ASSUME N == e` defines `N` as an
operator `N == e` without parameters.

### 5.8 Levels

Each expression has a level: 0 constant, 1 state (it reads variables), 2
action (it primes), 3 temporal. An operand of `'` or `UNCHANGED` must be of
level at most 1, of `ENABLED` and `\cdot` at most 2; in `[A]_v`,
`<<A>>_v`, `WF_v(A)` and `SF_v(A)`, `A` at most 2 and `v` at most 1. The
operands of the other built-in operators are at most actions: of `=`, `#`,
`\in`, the set operators, set and tuple constructors, function
application, `.f`, `EXCEPT` and its keys, `CHOOSE`, `{x \in S : P}` and
`{e : x \in S}`, and the ranges of every bound; the operands of the logical
operators, `IF`, `CASE`, records `[f |-> e]`, and the bodies of `\A`, `\E`
and `[x \in S |-> e]` may be temporal. `/\`, `\/`, `=>` and `<=>` may not
join a temporal formula and an action. A parameter of a definition allows,
for its argument, the least level its uses allow, and a declaration of a
module the same for what an `INSTANCE` substitutes for it; an argument or a
substitute of higher level is an error (§11.3). A call's level is that of
its definition and of the arguments for the parameters it uses outside
`ENABLED`, so `B(Next)` with `B(d) == ENABLED d` is a state predicate.

## 6 Expressions

### 6.1 Precedence

Each operator has a precedence range `[lo, hi]`. In `a op1 b op2 c`, the
expression parses as `(a op1 b) op2 c` when `op1`'s range lies above
`op2`'s, as `a op1 (b op2 c)` when below, and is an error when the ranges
overlap, unless `op1` and `op2` are the same left-associative operator.

| Operators | Range | Assoc. |
|---|---|---|
| `=>` | 1–1 | |
| `~>` `<=>` `\equiv` `-+->` | 2–2 | |
| `/\` `\land` `\/` `\lor` | 3–3 | left |
| `~` `\lnot` `\neg` (prefix) | 4–4 | |
| `[]` `<>` `ENABLED` `UNCHANGED` (prefix) | 4–15 | |
| `=` `#` `/=` `<` `>` `\leq` `<=` `=<` `\geq` `>=` `\in` `\notin` `\subseteq` `\subset` `\supseteq` `\supset` `\prec` `\succ` `\preceq` `\succeq` `\sim` `\simeq` `\ll` `\gg` `\asymp` `\approx` `\cong` `\sqsubset` `\sqsubseteq` `\sqsupset` `\sqsupseteq` `\doteq` `\propto` `:=` `::=` `|-` `-|` `|=` `=|` | 5–5 | |
| `\cdot` | 5–14 | left |
| `@@` | 6–6 | left |
| `:>` `<:` | 7–7 | |
| `\` | 8–8 | |
| `\cap` `\intersect` `\cup` `\union` | 8–8 | left |
| `SUBSET` `UNION` (prefix) | 8–8 | |
| `..` `...` | 9–9 | |
| `DOMAIN` (prefix) | 9–9 | |
| `!!` | 9–13 | |
| `##` `$` `$$` `??` `\uplus` `\sqcap` `\sqcup` | 9–13 | left |
| `\wr` | 9–14 | |
| `\X` `\times` | 10–13 | n-ary |
| `+` `++` `\oplus` `(+)` | 10–10 | left |
| `%` | 10–11 | |
| `%%` `\|` `\|\|` | 10–11 | left |
| `-` `--` `\ominus` `(-)` | 11–11 | left |
| `-` (prefix) | 12–12 | |
| `*` `**` `&` `&&` `\o` `\circ` `\odot` `(.)` `\otimes` `(\X)` `\star` `\bigcirc` `\bullet` | 13–13 | left |
| `/` `//` `\div` `\oslash` `(/)` | 13–13 | |
| `^` `^^` | 14–14 | |
| `'` `^+` `^*` `^#` (postfix) | 15–15 | |
| `[ ]` (application) | 16–16 | left |
| `.` (record field) | 17–17 | left |

`a \X b \X c` is the ternary product, not `(a \X b) \X c`.

### 6.2 Junction lists

A list of formulas each preceded by `/\` (or each by `\/`), whose bullets are
aligned in one column, is their conjunction (disjunction). An item extends
until the first token that begins at or left of the bullet's column; a token
there that is the same bullet starts the next item, and any other token ends
the list. A parenthesis, bracket, or brace that opened inside an item must
close inside it.

### 6.3 Logic

`TRUE`, `FALSE`, `BOOLEAN` (the set `{FALSE, TRUE}`). `~`, `/\`, `\/`, `=>`,
`<=>` (and `\equiv`) on Booleans. `/\` and `\/` evaluate left to right and
stop at the first operand that decides the result; so do `=>` and junction
lists. An operand that is not a Boolean is an error.

`\A x \in S : p` and `\E x \in S : p` over a finite `S`; several bounds
`\A x, y \in S, z \in T : p`; tuple binders `\E <<x, y>> \in S \X T : p`. The bound sets are computed
first; the bindings follow in the order of §7.4 with the first variable
varying fastest, which decides an action's successors and initial states
in order (§10).
Unbounded `\A x : p` and `\E x : p` are errors to evaluate.
`CHOOSE x \in S : p` is the first element of `S`, in the order of §7.4, that
satisfies `p`; none is an error. `CHOOSE x : p` is evaluable only as
§10.3 permits.

`=` and `#` (`/=`) compare values (§7.3).

### 6.4 Conditionals

`IF c THEN a ELSE b`. `CASE p1 -> e1 [] ... [] pn -> en [] OTHER -> e`
evaluates the guards in order and yields the arm of the first true one;
no true guard and no `OTHER` is an error.

### 6.5 Sets

Enumeration `{a, b}` and `{}`; `\in`, `\notin`; `\cup`, `\cap`, `\`;
`\subseteq`; `SUBSET S` (all subsets); `UNION S` (union of the elements);
`{x \in S : p}` (filter); `{e : x \in S, y \in T}` (image). Membership may
be decided for the infinite sets `Nat`, `Int`, `STRING`, `Seq(S)`,
`SUBSET S`, `[S -> T]`, `[a : S]`, and filters of them; enumerating an
infinite set is an error.

As in TLC, `{x \in S : p}` is computed at once when `S` is reducible: an
interval, or a set of elements that is not one TLC keeps as its
definition. TLC keeps as their definitions `SUBSET S`, `S \X T`,
`[S -> T]`, `[a : S]`, `Seq(S)`, `Nat`, `Int`, `STRING`; `UNION S` unless
`S` and its elements are sets of elements; `S \cup T` unless both are
reducible; `S \cap T` unless one is; `S \ T` unless `S` is; and a filter
of a set that is not reducible. Such a filter is lazy: membership
evaluates `p` for that element only, and `S` may be any value until the
filter is enumerated. A quantifier or `CHOOSE` over a value that is not a
set, or over `Nat`, `Int`, `STRING` or `Seq(S)`, is an error at once; over
another infinite set, the error is that of enumerating it.

A `UNION S` that TLC keeps is taken by quantifiers, set images and
`x \in S` in an action one element of `S` after another, in the standard
order of `S`, with any duplicates; `CHOOSE`, filters and functions take it
sorted. Once it has been counted, fingerprinted, or compared as the left
side of `=` or of the standard order, TLC holds its elements, and
quantifiers take them sorted too.

### 6.6 Functions

`[x \in S |-> e]` and `[x \in S, y \in T |-> e]`; application `f[a]` and
`f[a, b]` (which is `f[<<a, b>>]`); `DOMAIN f`; the function set
`[S -> T]`; `[f EXCEPT ![a] = e, ![b][c] = e2, !.r = e3]`, where `@` in a
replacement is the old value at that path. Applying `f` outside its domain
is an error.

As in TLC, `[x \in S |-> e]` is computed in full where it is evaluated,
except where it stays lazy: in the function position of an application
`f[a]` (directly, or as the value of the operator, LET definition or arm
`f` names), within the body of a lazy function, in a recursive function
definition (§5.3), and over a domain whose sets are not all reducible
(§6.5), such as an infinite one or one that is no set. A function definition that
is not recursive and names no variable is computed in full once, before
checking, if it can be. Applying a lazy function evaluates `e`
at that argument only, so an error elsewhere in its domain is not raised,
and `f[i \in S] == [j \in T |-> ... f[i][k] ...]` may use other values of
`f[i]` within `f[i]`. A lazy function is computed in full when it is
compared, fingerprinted, printed, or taken `DOMAIN` or `EXCEPT` of. One
that cannot be, being over an infinite domain or failing, prints as
`[x \in S |-> <expression LOC>]`: each bound's first name, or `<<a, b>>` for
a tuple pattern, with its domain, then `e` as TLC names an expression:
its location (§11.3), or, for a numeral, the numeral as written. A value
that holds such a function prints on one line. A function of several
bounds is computed with the first bound varying fastest, and an error
message prints it in that order; `Print` and `PrintT` print it sorted.

An EXCEPT path whose key is outside the domain leaves the
value unchanged and prints TLC's warning, `Warning: The EXCEPT was applied
to non-existing fields of the value at` and the location of `f`; the first
warning of a run adds `(Use the -nowarning option to disable this
warning.)`, and a warning already printed is not printed again.
`-nowarning` turns off TLC's warnings: these two, not SANY's.

### 6.7 Records

`[a |-> 1, b |-> 2]` is the function on `{"a", "b"}`; `r.a` is `r["a"]`.
`[a : S, b : T]` is the set of such records.

### 6.8 Tuples

`<<a, b, c>>` is the function on `1..3`. `<<>>` is the empty tuple.
`S \X T` is the set of pairs.

### 6.9 Action operators

In an action, `e'` is `e` evaluated in the next state; `UNCHANGED e` is
`e' = e`; `[A]_e` is `A \/ UNCHANGED e`; `<<A>>_e` is `A /\ ~UNCHANGED e`;
`ENABLED A` is true in a state from which `A` has a successor; `A \cdot B`
is composition.

Inside `ENABLED`, as in TLC, a primed variable of an instantiated module
written in `A` itself is not replaced by its substitution: `x' = e` gives
the variable named `x` a value, so with `INSTANCE M WITH x <- z, y <- z`,
`ENABLED (x' = 0 /\ y' = 1)` in `M` is true; `UNCHANGED x` and the change
`<<A>>_v` requires of `v` compare that variable likewise. An action passed to an
operator argument from outside the instance keeps its substitutions.

### 6.10 Temporal operators

`[]F`, `<>F`, `F ~> G` (`[](F => <>G)`), `WF_e(A)`, `SF_e(A)`, and
`F -+-> G`. Temporal formulas appear only in `SPECIFICATION` and `PROPERTY`
formulas (§10.5), and in definitions they use.

A temporal formula contains no raw action, a semantic error otherwise:
`[]A` and `<>A` of an action `A` must be `[][A]_e` and `<><<A>>_e`; the
operands of `~>` and `-+->` are not actions; and a quantifier over a
temporal formula has no action-level bound.

## 7 Values

### 7.1 Kinds

A value is a Boolean, an integer, a string, a model value (§9.2), a finite
or infinite set, or a function. Tuples, sequences, and records are
functions: `<<1, 2>> = [i \in 1..2 |-> i]` and
`[a |-> 1] = [x \in {"a"} |-> 1]`.

### 7.2 Integers

Integers are the signed 32-bit range of TLC. A result outside it is an
error (§11.3). `\div` and `%` are floor division and its non-negative
remainder; a zero divisor is an error.

### 7.3 Equality

Values of different kinds are unequal only when one is a model value or
when both are sets or both are functions; otherwise comparing them (for
example `1 = "a"`) is an error. Two sets are equal when they have the same
elements; two functions when they have the same domain and values. No
value is an element of an empty interval, such as `1..0`, even one that is
not an integer.

### 7.4 Order

Every set prints and enumerates its elements in the standard order:
Booleans `FALSE` before `TRUE`; integers by value; strings in order of
first appearance (§7.5); model values by declaration order; tuples and
functions by domain size, then element by element; sets by size, then
element by element; `Nat` before `Int`, which equal only themselves.
Elements of different kinds are ordered by kind.

### 7.5 String order

Strings are ordered by when tpp first meets them, in this order: the
built-in names of the language; the identifiers and numerals of the root
module and then of each module it uses, in the order those modules are
read; the string literals of every module, dependencies first; the
configuration; and finally strings made during checking. Record fields are
strings, so records print their fields in this order too.

### 7.6 Printing

A value prints as an expression that denotes it: `TRUE`, `-3`, `"a\"b"`, a
model value's name, `{1, 2}`, `<<1, 2>>`, `[a |-> 1, b |-> 2]`, and a
function on another domain as `(1 :> "a" @@ 2 :> "b")`. A function whose
domain is `1..n` prints as a tuple and one whose domain is a non-empty set
of strings prints as a record. A printed value longer than the line width
(80) is broken as TLC's pretty printer breaks it: each element of a long
set, tuple, or record on its own line, aligned under the first.

## 8 Standard modules

The standard modules are those of tla2tools, with the operators below
evaluated natively.

- **Naturals**: `Nat`, `+`, `-`, `*`, `^`, `<`, `>`, `\leq`, `\geq`, `%`,
  `\div`, `..`.
- **Integers**: Naturals and `Int`, prefix `-`.
- **Sequences**: `Seq`, `Len`, `\o`, `Append`, `Head`, `Tail`, `SubSeq`,
  `SelectSeq`.
- **FiniteSets**: `IsFiniteSet`, `Cardinality`.
- **Bags**: `IsABag`, `BagToSet`, `SetToBag`, `BagIn`, `EmptyBag`, `(+)`,
  `(-)`, `BagUnion`, `\sqsubseteq`, `SubBag`, `BagOfAll`, `BagCardinality`,
  `CopiesIn`.
- **Reals**: TLC's module of placeholders: `Real` is the string
  `"Reals"`, `a / b` is `CHOOSE m \in Real : m * b = a` (an error), and
  `Infinity` an unbounded `CHOOSE`; their definitions are on TLC's lines.
- **TLC**: `Print`, `PrintT`, `Assert`, `JavaTime`, `TLCGet`, `TLCSet`,
  `:>`, `@@`, `Permutations`, `SortSeq`, `RandomElement`, `Any`,
  `ToString`, `TLCEval`.

`RandomElement(S)` and the Randomization operators draw as TLC does, from
`java.util.Random` seeded with `-seed`. `RandomSubset(k, S)` takes
k indices from a linear congruential generator, `x' = (a * x + c) % m`
skipping those past |S|: m is the least number from max(|S|, 9) on that is
not divisible by 4 and has a square factor, a is 1 more than the product of
m's prime factors, x starts at a random index and c is a random one of
TLC's 1341 primes (§10.8). An index into a set of functions, records or
tuples is read in the mixed radix of its parts; for one of more than
2^31 - 1 elements the indices are instead `(i * (2^63 - 25) + l) % |S|`,
l the absolute value of a random long.

A string is no sequence, but `Len`, `Tail` and `SubSeq` take it as its
characters, and `\o` joins two strings: `Len("ab") = 2`, and `Tail` and
`SubSeq` of a string, and `"ab" \o "c"`, are strings. The other operators
of Sequences fail on a string, as does `\o` of a string and a sequence, and
a string equals no tuple: comparing them is an error (§7.3).

`Print(out, val)` writes `out` and `val` and yields `val`; `PrintT(out)`
writes `out` and yields `TRUE`; `Assert(c, out)` is `TRUE` when `c` is and
otherwise an error (§11.3). Printing a value, and `ToString`, enumerate
the sets in it, so an infinite `S \cup T` or `S \ T` is an error there.
`Any` is the set of every value; it prints as `ANY`. `TLCSet(i, v)`, for
a natural number `i`, keeps `v` in register `i` and yields `TRUE`;
`TLCGet(i)` yields it, and is an error when nothing was kept;
`TLCGet("level")` is the depth of the state a predicate is evaluated on
(of the step's first state in an action, 0 in Init and the assumptions);
`TLCGet("config")` is the record `[mode |-> "bfs", deadlock |-> b, worker
|-> n, seed |-> s]` of a search, without TLC's fields naming its jar and its
fingerprint polynomial; of a simulation, with `mode |-> "simulate"`, it
also has `traces` (-1 without `num=`), `depth`, `aril |-> "0"` and `sched
|-> "random"`, and its assumptions find the search's counters undefined. TLC implements `TLCGet` by an evaluation method, so
its errors carry that method's preamble (§11.3). `TLCGet` fails while the
model is read, before the assumptions are checked, as TLC's does before
its checker exists: a definition that uses it is not evaluated once as a
constant, but each time it is used.

## 9 Model configuration

### 9.1 Syntax

A configuration is a sequence of statements; `\*` and `(* *)` comments as
in §3.3. The keywords: `CONSTANT` is followed by assignments; `INIT`,
`NEXT`, `SPECIFICATION`, `SYMMETRY`, `VIEW`, `ALIAS`, `_PERIODIC`,
`_RL_REWARD` and `CHECK_DEADLOCK` by one name or value each, and may each
appear once; the others by any number of names. As in TLC, any token stands where a name is expected, and the
configuration is read before any module, so its errors come first, each
as TLC's `ConfigFileException` at the line it is found: a word that is not
a keyword where one is expected, a keyword repeated or followed by nothing, an assignment without
`=` or `<-`, a set without its `}`.

| Statement | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `CONSTANT`, `CONSTANTS` | `c = v` binds constant `c` to the value `v`; `c <- Op` replaces `c` by the definition `Op`; `d <- [M] Op` replaces the definition `d` of module `M` by `Op` of the root module, and `d = [M] v` gives it the value `v`; `c = c` binds `c` to the model value `c`; a definition `d = v` is the value `v`, its body never evaluated |
| `INIT`, `NEXT` | the initial predicate and next-state action |
| `SPECIFICATION` | a formula `Init /\ [][Next]_v /\ Fairness`, possibly through an instance, `I(y)!Spec` too; with `INIT` or `NEXT` too, an error |
| `INVARIANT`, `INVARIANTS` | state predicates checked in every reachable state |
| `PROPERTY`, `PROPERTIES` | temporal formulas the specification must imply |
| `CONSTRAINT`, `CONSTRAINTS` | state predicates bounding the explored states |
| `ACTION_CONSTRAINT`, `ACTION_CONSTRAINTS` | actions bounding the explored transitions |
| `SYMMETRY` | a set of permutations of model values |
| `VIEW` | the expression whose value identifies states |
| `ALIAS` | the expression a trace's states are printed as (§11.2) |
| `CHECK_DEADLOCK` | `TRUE` (the default) or `FALSE` |
| `POSTCONDITION`, `POSTCONDITIONS` | constant formulas checked once the states are explored (§10.9) |

### 9.2 Values

A value in a configuration is a natural number, a string, `TRUE`,
`FALSE`, a model value (any other name), or a set `{v1, ..., vn}` of
values. As in TLC, `-1` is two tokens: the model value `-`, then a name. A model
value equals only itself.

## 10 Model checking

### 10.1 Constants

Each declared constant shall be bound by the configuration. Then the
assumptions are evaluated (§4.5).

### 10.2 Initial states

The initial predicate is evaluated as a generator: a conjunction is
evaluated left to right; a disjunction, an `\E`, an `IF`, or a `CASE` tries
each alternative; `P => Q` evaluates `P`, then continues with `Q` if it is
`TRUE` and without it if it is `FALSE`; `f[a]` for a lazy `f` (§6.6),
here only a recursive function or one over a domain not reducible, is
its body with its bound names given `a`; a conjunct `v = e` with `v` unassigned assigns `v`, and
`v \in S` with `v` unassigned assigns each element of `S` in turn; any
other formula must be `TRUE` for the alternative to continue. A state in
which some variable is unassigned is an error. Each state produced, once
the state constraints admit it, is an initial state.

### 10.3 Successor states

The next-state action is evaluated in a state `s` as the initial predicate
is, with primed variables `v'` in the place of variables, and unprimed
variables read from `s`. An action is split at its disjunctions, `\E`
quantifiers, and the definitions it refers to; each part that produces a
state is a transition. `UNCHANGED v` assigns `v'` the value of `v`. A
definition's parameter may stand for a primed variable, `Op(v')`, and a
constant operator for the definition that replaces it (§9.1); both are
followed. `f[a]`, for any lazy `f` (§6.6), is its body with its bound names
given `a`, so its disjunctions are alternatives and it may assign. A
successor in which some variable is unassigned is an error. `\A x \in S :
A` is the conjunction of `A` for each `x`, the first, then the others from
the last; as everywhere until every variable is assigned, each true
disjunct in it is a way to the successor, and each way counts as a state
generated.

### 10.4 Search

States are explored breadth first from the initial states, in the order
they are produced. A state is new when no explored state has the same
fingerprint: its value, or the value of the `VIEW` if one is given, up to
the group the `SYMMETRY` permutations generate (so `Permutations(A) \cup
Permutations(B)` relates the states either relates and their
compositions). TLC warns of a set of a symmetry that permutes nothing,
`Warning: The set S has been defined to be a symmetry set but contains less
than two elements.`, with `sets` and `have` for several, joined by `, and
`: it reads the arguments of the `SYMMETRY` definition's body, and names
all of them when they are as many as the permutations, else each
`Permutations(S)` of a constant set no model value of which a permutation
moves; a set is named by its text without spaces, or by the constant the
configuration replaces with it (`C <- S`). Each new state that satisfies the state
constraints, reached by a transition that satisfies the action constraints,
is checked against the invariants and queued. A reachable state with no
successor is a deadlock unless `CHECK_DEADLOCK` is `FALSE`.

The *states generated* count is the number of initial states produced plus
the number of transitions taken, duplicates included; *distinct states* is
the number of new states; the *depth* is the length of the longest shortest
path from an initial state, counted in states.

### 10.5 Properties

A `PROPERTY` holds when every behavior of the specification satisfies it.
A behavior is an infinite sequence of states, each transition of which is a
step of the next-state action or a stuttering step, that satisfies the
specification's fairness conditions. A property of the form `[]P` with `P`
a state predicate is checked as an invariant; a state predicate `P` is
checked on each initial state, after the invariants, as TLC checks it
while it computes them: `Error: Property P is violated by the initial
state:` and the state, with no counts (exit 13), or an error evaluating it
as one of an invariant there; `[][A]_v` is checked on
every transition; other properties are checked over the state graph after
the search (liveness checking). A property is split into its
conjuncts, following definitions and a call of an instance's definition
without parameters (`I!Spec`); a part of several is named in messages by
its location, as `Invariant line 3, col 7 to line 3, col 15 of module M is
violated.` A state whose step violates an action property is not left on
the queue. In a temporal formula, `IF p THEN A ELSE
B` is `(p /\ A) \/ (~p /\ B)`. As TLC checks the negation of a property,
a constant in it is folded through `/\` and `\/`; `[]<>c` and `<>[]c`
joined at its top by them are checked with `c`'s value, but a constant
under any other `[]` or `<>` is in TLC's tableau, which never evaluates
it: `FALSE` there holds, so `<>TRUE \/ <>(x = 1)` is violated by a
behavior in which `x` is never 1. Liveness checking with a `CONSTRAINT` or
`ACTION_CONSTRAINT` prints TLC's warning, after the constant definitions
are evaluated and before the assumptions, `Warning: Declaring state
or action constraints during liveness checking is dangerous: …`, and with a
`SYMMETRY`, before it, `Warning: Declaring symmetry during liveness
checking is dangerous. …`; a simulation does not. Only the first warning of
a run is followed by `(Use the -nowarning option to disable this
warning.)`. A counterexample whose cycle is one state, with a step back to
it by any action, ends `State n: Stuttering`; in model checking, when a
conjunct of the property's negation (in disjunctive normal form) is
`<>[]A` or `[]<>A` with `A` no temporal formula, or a `<>F` in it has a
`[]` in `F`, TLC then warns that the stuttering may come of no
`SPECIFICATION` (with `INIT` and `NEXT`), or of a specification `Spec`
without fairness, `... the behavior specification Spec defined at line
..., col ... of module M. ...` (its whole definition). A conjunct with an
action that is neither is TLC's `Error: Temporal formulas containing
actions must be of forms <>[]A or []<>A.` (exit 255), before the initial
states are computed. As TLC, `[A]_v` and `<<A>>_v` in a temporal formula
test `v` first: a step that leaves `v` unchanged decides them, `A`
unevaluated.

TLC evaluates the predicates of the temporal properties during the
search, and an error there is reported then. On each initial state,
before its invariants, it evaluates the literals of each initial node of
a property's tableau, up to a false one, in the formula's order, or,
for a property without a tableau, each state predicate but `ENABLED`.
The first error is printed with `While working on the initial state:`
and the state, and the initial states are computed on; a second error
ends the search with its trace of positions (exit 75); without one, the
run stops once they are computed, without `Finished computing initial
states`, with the counts and exit 0, even after an invariant violation.
As it expands a state, it evaluates `ENABLED` predicates and fairness's
enabledness on the state, other state predicates on each successor, and
action predicates and fairness's steps on each step to a successor and
on the stuttering step. An error there is an unexpected exception, with
the counts as the state is expanded and the depth (exit 255).

### 10.6 Fairness

`WF_v(A)`: a behavior in which `<<A>>_v` is eventually always enabled is
fair only if it takes infinitely many `<<A>>_v` steps. `SF_v(A)`: if
`<<A>>_v` is enabled infinitely often then infinitely many such steps.

### 10.7 Counterexamples

A trace is the shortest path from an initial state to the bad state. A
liveness counterexample is a path to a cycle (a lasso) on which the
property fails and the fairness conditions hold.

When several lassos qualify, TLC's choice is not specified (it can differ
between runs), so a conforming test admits exactly one.

### 10.8 Simulation

With `-simulate`, the checker explores random behaviors instead of the
state graph, as TLC does with one worker. `-seed S` (random if not given)
and `-aril A` choose the behaviors: the generator is Java's
`java.util.Random`, seeded with `S` and advanced `A` doubles, whose first
long seeds the generator that draws the behaviors. `RandomElement` and
the Randomization operators draw from two more, both seeded with `S`: one
for the model and the initial states, one for the behaviors. `num=N`
bounds the number of behaviors (unbounded if not given) and `-depth D`
their length in steps (100).

The initial states are computed and checked first, against the
invariants; a property that is a state predicate is not checked at all,
as TLC's simulation ignores it. Those outside the constraints are dropped,
then `Finished computing initial states: N distinct state generated.`
reports the rest (no state left is an error). Each behavior starts at one
of them drawn at random. In each state, an action (§10.3) is drawn at
random, then a prime from a fixed list of 1341, and the actions are tried
in steps of that prime until one has a successor in the constraints and
action constraints. Each successor is checked as it is generated, against
the invariants then the action properties, and one of those kept is
drawn as the next state. A behavior ends at its length, or at a state
with no successor kept, a deadlock unless `CHECK_DEADLOCK` is `FALSE`.
`TLCGet("diameter")` is the number of the behavior, from 1. A temporal
property is then checked on the
behavior, on a graph TLC builds as the states arrive. For a property
whose only temporal parts are `[]<>P` and `<>[]P`, as with fairness alone,
the graph has every state and step of the behavior, and every state may
also stutter. Otherwise TLC checks the property with a tableau, on its
product with the behavior: a node of the product, a state with a tableau
node, gets its successors when it is first met at a position of the
behavior, by the state stuttering or taking the behavior's next step there
(only stuttering at the last state), and keeps them; a later position of
the same state adds none. Which lasso is reported is not specified.

A violation prints the behavior up to the bad state, each state labeled
with the action it was taken by (the first by the last initial predicate:
a definition's name, else `Initial predicate`, and where it is written),
and the states equal to the one before them left out, compared variable
by variable from the end. Nothing is evaluated again. A successor that
leaves a variable unassigned prints as in model checking, with the
behavior to it, then the failure of TLC's postcondition that writes the
behavior out, and exits with status 75. An evaluation error prints TLC's
unexpected-exception report, but for an error TLC raises as a
`TLCRuntimeException`, one with a preamble of §11.3 or an undefined primed
variable, in a behavior: that prints as `Error:` and its message, then
the behavior, and exits with status 255 or 151; as the initial states are
computed it is a `java.lang.RuntimeException` (exit 255). With `-continue` a violation ends its
behavior and the simulation goes on, ending as if none was found.
`TLCSet("exit", TRUE)` ends the simulation after the step that sets it,
as if it were done. The
state counts of a simulation are unspecified (§11.1).

### 10.9 Postconditions

A `POSTCONDITION` is checked when the search or the simulation is done,
after the liveness checking, and after an error is reported: a violated
invariant, action property, property of an initial state, or temporal
property, a deadlock, or a successor not completely specified, once its
trace and the trace built again for it are printed (§11.2). The
postconditions are checked in order, each evaluated with no state, so
`TLCGet("level")` is 0 and a variable is undefined: the first that is
false prints `Error: Postcondition P at line ... of module M is false.`,
and the first that fails `Error: Evaluating postcondition P at line ... of
module M failed.` and the error, or that `TLC expected a boolean value,
but did not find one.` and its location; the rest are not checked. Each
name is resolved first: one the spec does not define as an operator, a
constant definition TLC evaluated at startup, or one with parameters, is
TLC's unexpected `java.lang.RuntimeException`, and no postcondition is
checked. After an error the exit status is the error's, and an error
resolving a name is ignored; else a false or failed postcondition replaces
`Model checking completed. No error has been found.`, before the counts,
with exit 10, and an error resolving one with exit 255. A simulation
reports an error resolving a name as `Error:` and its message, exit 151,
even after an error, whose status it replaces; after an initial state
that violates an invariant, it is followed by `While working on the
initial state:` and the state, exit 255.

## 11 Output

### 11.1 Normalized output

Normalized output is the standard output with these lines removed: the
version and start-up banner, `Parsing file`, `Semantic processing`,
`Starting...`, `Computing initial states...`, `Computed N initial
states...`, `Progress(...)`, `Checking temporal properties for`,
`Finished checking temporal properties`, `Implied-temporal checking`,
`Finished in`, a simulation's `Progress: N states checked.`, `The number
of states generated:` and `Simulation using seed`, the average outdegree, the fingerprint-collision report,
and the block that begins `Error: The error occurred when TLC was
evaluating the nested expressions`. Timestamps are removed from `Finished
computing initial states`, and runs of blank lines are one blank line.
When parsing or semantic analysis fails, the normalized output is the
single line `Error: Parsing or semantic analysis failed.`; the diagnostics
before it are unspecified. The exit status follows as a final line
`exit N`.

### 11.2 Results

Output printed by `Print` and `PrintT` while assumptions are checked comes
first. Then

```
Finished computing initial states: N distinct states generated.
```

or, when the initial predicate produced some state more than once,
`Finished computing initial states: G states generated, with N of them
distinct.`

and, for a correct model,

```
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
N states generated, M distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is D.
```

A violation prints its error (§11.3), then, if there is a trace,
`Error: The behavior up to this point is:` and the trace, then the counts.
Each state of a trace is `State i: <Action line l1, col c1 to line l2, col
c2 of module M>` (`<Initial predicate>` for the first) followed by the
state as a junction list `/\ v = value` of its variables in TLC's order
(below), a single variable without the bullet, and a blank line. The action
is named by the definition the step's disjunct belongs to, with the
values of its constant arguments, `<Inc(1,2) ...>`, and located by that
disjunct. A definition seen through an instance that substitutes, as SANY
substitutes each declared name it does not, is one action, `I!A`, located
at the `INSTANCE` statement; a step of a specification's `[][N]_v` that
is no definition is `Action`, there too through such an instance. In a
simulation the initial predicate is named and located likewise.

With an `ALIAS`, each state of a trace, a counterexample, a simulated
behavior, or an initial state that violates an invariant or property is
printed as the alias's value on the step from it to the state after it,
the last state's to itself and a cycle's last to the state it goes back
to, with `TLCGet("level")` the state's number: a record is printed as the
state, its fields as variables in the order its constructor gives them,
any other value leaves the state as it is. TLC resolves the alias as it
prints a state, so an undefined name, a constant, or one with parameters
is, like an error evaluating it, printed as a variable `_ALIASEvalError`,
a string of the error's message, after the state's variables.

TLC builds a trace by evaluating Init, and Next from each state, until it
finds the state, so what they print is printed again as the trace is
printed. After a deadlock, a violated invariant or action property, or a
successor not completely specified, it builds the trace once more, for a
postconditions (§10.9), before the counts; so too after an error in Next on a state
with no successor generated before it, when deadlock is checked. An error
building a state ends the trace there, reported as `Error: TLC threw an
unexpected exception.` with `tlc2.tool.EvalException` and its message.

TLC's order of the variables is the reverse of the order in which SANY's
context of the root module, a `java.util.Hashtable`, enumerates them. The
table holds the names of SANY's 72 built-in operators, put in reverse
order of their definition, then the module's symbols in the order SANY
meets them: those of each extended module that are not LOCAL, in that
module's order; then, in the module's text, each declared or defined name,
the name of a RECURSIVE operator where it is declared, the name of a named
theorem or assumption, and the name of a nested module. An instance puts
the definitions of the instantiated module, then its named theorems and
assumptions, as that module's own table enumerates them; a named instance
`I` puts each as `I!Op`, its module instances too, then `I`. A name's hash
is Java's `String.hashCode`; the table starts with 11 buckets, puts a new
entry at the head of its bucket, and when it holds three quarters of its
capacity it grows to twice plus one, moving entries from the last bucket
to the first, each to the head of its new bucket. It enumerates the
buckets from the last to the first, each from its head.

A liveness counterexample is introduced by `Error: Temporal property P was
violated.` and `Error: The following behavior constitutes a
counter-example:`; it ends with `Back to state i: <Action ...>` when it
loops back to state `i`, or `State n: Stuttering` when it stutters forever.

An error inside an operator of §8, which TLC implements in Java, such as
in the test of `SelectSeq`, follows a preamble for each such operator it is
inside, outermost first: `Attempted to apply the operator overridden by the
Java method` / its signature, as in `public static tlc2.value.impl.Value
tlc2.module.Sequences.SelectSeq(tlc2.value.impl.Value,tlc2.value.impl.Value),`
/ `but it produced the following error:`. The location of the inner error,
if any, ends the message. Errors that TLC raises as `EvalException`s, which
are those the operators of §8 raise about their own arguments, have no
preamble.

A message that names an expression is followed by its location, `line l,
col c to line l2, col c2 of module M`.

## 12 Exclusions

Not covered: the proof language (`PROOF`, steps, `USE`, `BY`; skipped,
except that a `HIDE` may name only theorems, assumptions, and steps, and a
theorem's statement is kept for §5.7), computing with real numbers and
with `\AA` and `\EE` (which TLC cannot either; §3.5, §11.3), `-generate`,
the configuration's `_PERIODIC`, `_RL_REWARD` and `_POSSIBLE` (rejected),
writing simulated behaviors to files (`-simulate file=`), simulation with
several workers, the order of `Print` output in a simulation,
checkpointing, multiple workers' scheduling, distributed TLC, and the
TLA⁺ Toolbox outputs (`-tool`).
